CIS 557: Programming for the Web  
Major Group Project, Name [TBD]  
Team Members: [Logan Ayliffe](mailto:logan.ayliffe@seas.upenn.edu), [Daria Bazueza](mailto:bazuevad@seas.upenn.edu), [Archith Moran](mailto:archith.mohan.wg20@wharton.upenn.edu)

## The Most Important Part!
We are students who are learning how to build a complicated project using new technologies and new methodologies. As such, we will not create a team agreement on the first try that will cover everything!

In the same way that we will iteratatively improve and grow our project, we will iterate and improve our team agreement. We will be especially careful to watch for circumstances that encourage us to **add to, modify, or remove from** our team agreement

### Interpersonal  :raised_hands:
#### We make decisions together
- Every effort will be made to ensure everyone can attend the meetings with our PM
- If a member of the team cannot be present for a meeting with our PM, they will support the decision that was made
#### We will be respectful
- Everyone has equal voice and valuable contribution
- We will always let people finish what they’re saying
- It’s OK to disagree with each other
- No personal attacks - we debate the merit of ideas, not people
- Respect your team member’s time
- When pairing, turn off distractions (email, IM)
#### We will give constructive feedback and take action on it
- We do not hesitate to put things right at the earliest possible opportunity
- We owe each other feedback to help each other learn and grow
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or for feedback

### Communication  :mega:
#### We will favor asynchronous communication 
- Favor thoughtful text-based, asynchronous communication
    - We will use channels most appropriate for a piece of communication - e.g. slack for logistics, github issues for user stories 
    - We will title communication and always lead with the most important information
    - We will communicate directly with the intended recipient of the communication - e.g. use @name as often as needed
- Meetings are the last resort, not the first option, but some topics are best discussed in a meeting, so do not hesitate to ask for a meeting when needed
    - But make sure you have a clear meeting agenda and a write up for discussion in the meeting
    - Document meeting outcomes for the benefit of people who may not have been able to make it / or were not required to be a part of it
#### We will share schedules to allow for pair programming at the start of every sprint
- This will allow us to ensure we have some subset of our time available for synchronous communication and work.
#### We will document decisions throughly
- If it's important, critical, or fundamental, **write it up**, don't chat it down

### Technical  :computer:
(Much of the technical section relates to the project specificiation, and is likely to be first up for refinement once we fully understand the requirements of the spec)
#### We will use GitHub projects and the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology when implementing this project.
- We will write-up our design decisions in our GitHUb wiki page
- We will define our milestones
- We will link all of our features / tasks to an issue in Github
- Our issues will be parts of our milestones, and will have labels and assignees
- We will use proper GitHUb flow
- Test Driven Development is a requirement for the project
- We will regularly consult with our assigned TA for feedback on these types of project management issues
- Don’t break the CI build!
#### We will not engage in scope creep
- As we are learning and have limited time to implement the features within the semester, it is critical to focus on the criteria for DONE for each user story and limit scope creep accordingly.
#### We will make design and implementation choices together 
- We will adhere to the project specification for particular tools and techniques
- Where something is unspecified or there is a choice (e.g. database) we will decide together AND check with course staff before using any 3rd party software, packages, or modules
- Everyone reviews a PR before deployment and merge
- Pairing or code reviews are required for any shipping code
#### We will limit fragmentation of work
- Incomplete stories are not good – it is better to help get an existing story to “done” than to start another story that can’t be finished in the current sprint
