# Design Decision notes

## CSS

Basic styling is provided by the Solar theme ([Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) Clone) included with [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/solar/) which is a theming library for Bootstrap.

## Components

Bootstrap components are used whenever possible for styling consistency.
